# 🛡️ WildGuard: Machine Learning-Driven Predictions for Wildlife Conservation

WildGuard is a machine learning-based solution designed to help conservationists and authorities **predict and prevent wildlife poaching, illegal trade, and related activities**. Using data science techniques, supervised learning, and an interactive dashboard, this project classifies regions into **Low**, **Moderate**, or **High Risk** zones to support proactive wildlife protection.

## 📌 Features

- Cleaned and preprocessed real-world wildlife data
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and anomalies
- Supervised Machine Learning using Random Forest Classifier
- Risk classification (Low, Moderate, High)
- Dashboard with visual analytics for real-time decision-making
